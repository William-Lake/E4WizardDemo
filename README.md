### Motivation
I'm relatively new to Computer Programming and as part of my work have been learning more about building software with the Eclipse E4 Rich Client Platform. The process of building a custom Wizard with dynamically loading pages took me longer than I would like to admit, but in the end I did find a way to make it happen. This example program exists to provide others with similar goals a jumping off point.

 1. Open the "Install New Software" Window.

 2. Choose the download site for your version of Eclipse.
	 *- In the drop down menu labeled "Works With" at the top of the "Install Software" window, choose the site for your Eclipse Version.*
	 
 3. Search for "E4" and install "Eclipse e4 Tools Developer Resources".
	 *- Look just below the drop down menu to find the search bar and type in "E4". Click the check box to the left of the package labeled "Eclipse e4 Tools Developer Resources" and click the "Next" button at the bottom of the window.*
	 
 4. Follow the Wizard prompts to finish installing the software.

### Important Classes

 - ButtonHolder
	 - The first page you are greeted with when you open the program. Hosts the primary button which triggers launching the Wizard.
 - OpenWizard
	 - The class that runs when the button on the main page is pressed. It creates and opens the Wizard.
 - WizardDemo
	 - This is the class that instantiates, organizes, and serves up all the pages that make up your Wizard.
 - Various WizardPages
	 - I.e. WizardDemoPage1, WizardDemoPage2A, WizardDemoPage2B
	 - These classes each represent one custom WizardPage, in essence describing how they will look and some of their inherent functionality.

### Important Application.e4xmi features

 - Handler/Command
	 - There is one Handler (Open Wizard) and one Command (Open Wizard) within this program's Application.e4xmi.
	 - The Command consists of a Label and an ID.
	 - The Handler is also given a Label and ID, but is additionally pointed towards the OpenWizard Command as well as the OpenWizard class that will run once it is activated.
	 - In short, when a Command is triggered it will activate any Handlers that are pointed at it, which in turn will run any classes that are associated with those Handlers.
