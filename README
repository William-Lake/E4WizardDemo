WizardDemo is a simple example of a custom wizard built using Eclipse E4 RCP.

It consists of a handful of classes:
	1 Composite : ButtonHolder
	1 Handler : OpenWizard
	1 Custom Wizard Class : WizardDemo
	3 Custom Wizard Pages : WizardDemoPage1
							WizardDemoPage2A
							WizardDemoPage2B
And some items in the Application.e4xmi:
	1 Command : Open Wizard
	1 Handler : Open Wizard
	1 TrimmedWindow : Wizard Demo
	1 Part : Button Holder

Each class contains a collection of comments in an attempt to provide as much explanation
	as possible.

Regarding the Application.e4xmi, the most important notes are:
	-A command and handler were used to trigger opening the wizard. There are other
		ways to achieve this, but it serves as a good secondary example for using commands
		& handlers as they can also be used in other interesting ways.
		Notice that the command is pretty simple, and that the handler MUST point
		at the command it is associated with.
	-The TrimmedWindow is the main window of the application. You can alter the 
		default window size, where it is placed on screen, and the window title.
	-The Part is the framework for a part of an application (E.g. an area you want
		to see or work with in your app), and what class it's associated with for 
		construction. Notice that "Class URI" is where you indicate where it's associated 
		class resides. Additionally, if you were building a new application you 
		could click on 'Class URI' to generate a class with the basics.
